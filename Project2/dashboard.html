        <h1>The Nature of Cybersecurity</h1>
        <p>Before we can talk about the nature of cybersecurity, Let's talk about what is cybersecurity.
            <h2>What is cybersecurity anyway?</h2>
            <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of deploying people, policies,
            processes and technologies to protect organizations, their critical systems and 
            sensitive information from digital attacks.
            Cybersecurity knows no borders and is not 
            limited to any one geography or culture. 
            The challenges and opportunities facing cybersecurity experts, policymakers and the public areglobal
             in nature and require globally-minded solutions at all levels. At the same time, rapid changes in 
             technology have a direct impact on societies around the world and the changingthreat environment. 
             The Hewlett Foundationâ€™s 2019 Cyber Initiative Grantee Convening will focus on two pillars:
              (1) the global nature of cyberspace and (2) emerging technologychallenges and solutions. 
              We will come together to share our work in this space and identify opportunities for meaningful collaboration.</br></br>

            <h2>Why Do we Need Cybersecurity?</h2>
            Cybersecurity is the state or process of protecting and recovering computer systems, networks, devices, and programs from any type of cyber attack. Cyber attacks are an increasingly sophisticated and evolving danger to your sensitive data, as attackers employ new methods powered by social engineering and artificial intelligence (AI) to circumvent traditional data security controls.

            The fact of the matter is the world is increasingly reliant on technology and this reliance will continue as we introduce the next generation of new technology that will have access to our connected devices via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.
            
            To keep customer data protected while embracing new technology, intelligent cloud security solutions should be implemented alongside strong password policies like multi-factor authentication to mitigate unauthorized access.
            <h2>The importance of Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p>
                Cybersecurity's importance is on the rise. Fundamentally, our society is more technologically reliant than ever before and there is no sign that this trend will slow. Data leaks that could result in identity theft are now publicly posted on social media accounts. Sensitive information like social security numbers, credit card information and bank account details are now stored in cloud storage services like Dropbox or Google Drive.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fact of the matter is whether you are an individual, small business, or large multinational, you rely on computer systems every day. Pair this with the rise in cloud services, poor cloud service security, smartphones, and the Internet of Things (IoT) and we have a myriad of potential security vulnerabilities that didn't exist a few decades ago. We need to understand the difference between cybersecurity and information security, even though the skillsets are becoming more similar.
            </p>

                Governments around the world are bringing more attention to cybercrimes. GDPR is a great example. It has increased the reputational damage of data breaches by forcing all organizations that operate in the EU to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Communicate data breaches</li>
                    <li>Appoint a data protection officer</li>
                    <li>Require user consent to process information</li>
                    <li>Anonymize data for privacy</li>
                    
                </ul>
